# TitanCooldownCrosshairs
Titanfall 2 mod: Pilot ability cooldown crosshairs added and optimized onto titans

This Mod aims to add pilot ability cooldown crosshairs onto titans

| Following crosshairs: | Left Crosshair           | Right Crosshair                       |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Ion                   | Laser Tripwire(Utility)  | none                                  |
| Scorch                | Gas Canisters(Utility)   | Firewall(Offensive)                   |
| Northstar             | Hover(Utility)           | Cluster Missile(Offensive)            |
| Ronin                 | Phase Shift(Utility)     | Arc Wave(Offensive)                   |
| Tone                  | Particle Wall(Defensive) | Sonar(Utility)                        |
| Legion                | Gunshield(Defensive)     | Powershot(Offensive)                  |
| Monarch               | Rearm(Utility)           | Missile Salvo/Missile Rack(Offensive) |

BTW, crosshairs don't work properly with Vortex-..-, Thermalshield, and MTMS (Multi Target Missile System).
Ion has only one ability crosshair due to incompactibility issues.

I selected **Left Crosshairs** based on ability synergy, basically, I placed abilities which would benefit more out of them
than a defensive ability like infinite swordblock or broken Vortex etc.

**Right Crosshairs** are binded to offensive abilities for all titans except for Tone, since her ability has no cooldown.
